While keeping your knees and hips bent slightly and your abs tight, contract your glutes to slowly \"kick\" the working leg back in a semicircular arc as high as it will comfortably go as you breathe out. Tip: At full extension, squeeze your glutes for a second in order to achieve a peak contraction. Now slowly bring your working leg forward, resisting the pull of the cable until you reach the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

Start the movement by lifting the left leg higher than the right leg. Then lower the left leg as you lift the right leg. Continue alternating in this manner (as though you are doing a flutter kick in water) until you have done the recommended amount of repetitions for each leg.

Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position. As you exhale, lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second. Tip: At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it. Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg. Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.  Variations: For this exercise you can also perform all of the repetitions with one leg first and then the other one. Additionally, you can also add ankle weights."
